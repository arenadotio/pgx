      variables are available.

      [max_message_length] is the maximum message length accepted from the back-end.
      The default is [Sys.max_string_length], which means that we will try to
      read as much data from the back-end as we can, and this may cause us to
      run out of memory (particularly on 64 bit machines), causing a
      possible denial of service.  You may want to set this to a smaller
      size to avoid this happening. *)

  val close : t -> unit monad

      after itself. *)

      exception will be thrown. *)

      If [f] throws an exception, the transaction will be rolled back. Otherwise
      the transaction will be commited. It is an error to call [commit] or

        the given parameters [params], returning the result rows (if any).

        There are several steps involved at the protocol layer:
        (1) a "portal" is created from the statement, binding the
        parameters in the statement (Bind).
        (2) the portal is executed (Execute).
        (3) we synchronise the connection (Sync).

        The optional [?portal] parameter may be used to name the portal
        created in step (1) above (otherwise the unnamed portal is used).
        This is only important if you want to call {!describe_portal}
        to find out the result types. *)
